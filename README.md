# How to Self Host

1) Download all the files here
2) Create a firebase database (if you do not know how then you shouldnt be here)
3) Get the serviceAccount and drag it into the directory and name it "serviceAccount.json" this will connect it to your database
4) Add your bot token into db/main.json
5) Turn your bot online before you add it to your server

# Why are some files missing

The only files that are missing are the files that require a premium subscription on the bot (obvious reasons)

# Why OpenSource

If any developer has an idea, they can just add it.
